# Embedded Virtual Machine Core Project

This repository contains the designs, documentations, and source files for the Embedded Virtual Machine (`embvm`) project's core interfaces, libraries, and subsystems. This project is required to build Embedded VM applications and reusable modules (including drivers, OS interfaces, subsystems, and more).

Note that this project is dual-licensed. The core project is released under GPLv3 for open-source terms. [Commercial licenses](https://embeddedartistry.com/product/embedded-virtual-machine-commercial-license), which provide holders with the ability to create and distribute software without open-source obligations, can be purchased in the [Embedded Artistry store](https://embeddedartistry.com/store).

# Project Status

This project is under active development. Reusable programs, platforms, and drivers have been successfully written using the Embedded VM, and they run on ARM Cortex-M4 embedded platforms. Supporting utilities are continually being tested, tuned, and optimized. Interfaces are evolving, and many interfaces still need to be created. A number of reusable subsystems are planned, but not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

The instructions below will help you download and build the project.

Detailed documentation on the design and use of the Embedded VM can be found in the [docs/](docs/) folder.

If this is your first encounter with the Embedded VM project, we recommend beginning with our [Getting Started Guide](docs/UsingTheFramework/getting_started.md).

### Requirements

This project uses [Embedded Artistry's standard Meson build system](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/), and dependencies are described in detail [on our website](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/).

At a minimum you will need:

* [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com), which is used to store binary files in this repository
* [Meson](#meson-build-system) is the build system
* Some kind of compiler for your target system.
    - This repository has been tested with:
        - gcc-7, gcc-8, gcc-9
        - arm-none-eabi-gcc
        - Apple clang
        - Mainline clang

#### git-lfs

This project stores some files using [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com).

To install `git-lfs` on Linux:

```
sudo apt install git-lfs
```

To install `git-lfs` on OS X:

```
brew install git-lfs
```

Additional installation instructions can be found on the [`git-lfs` website](https://git-lfs.github.com).

#### Meson Build System

The [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) build system depends on `python3` and `ninja-build`.

To install on Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip ninja-build
```

To install on OSX:

```
brew install python3 ninja
```

Meson can be installed through `pip3`:

```
pip3 install meson
```

If you want to install Meson globally on Linux, use:

```
sudo -H pip3 install meson
```

### Getting the Source

This project uses [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com), so please install it before cloning. If you cloned prior to installing `git-lfs`, simply run `git lfs pull` after installation.

This project is hosted on GitHub. You can clone the project directly using this command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/embvm/embvm-core
```

If you don't clone recursively, be sure to run the following command in the repository or your build will fail:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Building

If Make is installed, the project can be built by issuing the following command:

```
make
```

This will build all targets for your current architecture.

You can clean builds using:

```
make clean
```

You can eliminate the generated `buildresults` folder using:

```
make distclean
```

You can also use  `meson` directly for compiling.

Create a build output folder:

```
meson buildresults
```

And build all targets by running

```
ninja -C buildresults
```

Cross-compilation is handled using `meson` cross files. Example files are included in the [`build/cross`](build/cross/) folder. You can write your own cross files for your specific processor by defining the toolchain, compilation flags, and linker flags. These settings will be used to compile the project.

Cross-compilation must be configured using the meson command when creating the build output folder. For files stored within `build/cross`, we provide a Makefile `CROSS` to simplify the process. This variable will automatically supply the proper Meson argument, `build/cross/` prefix, and `.txt` filename extension.

You can use a single file, or you can layer multiple files by separating the names with a colon.

```
make CROSS=arm:cortex-m4_hardfloat
```

You can also do this manually with the Meson interface. Note, however, that you will need to include a special `--cross-file=build/cross/embvm.txt` cross file to ensure that the required Embedded VM settings are applied.

```
meson buildresults --cross-file build/cross/arm.txt --cross-file build/cross/cortex-m4_hardfloat.txt --cross-file=build/cross/embvm.txt
```

Following that, you can run `make` (at the project root) or `ninja -C buildresults` to build the project.

> **Note:** Tests will not be cross-compiled. They will only be built for the native platform.

**Full instructions for working with the build system, including topics like using alternate toolchains and running supporting tooling, are documented in [Embedded Artistry's Standardized Meson Build System](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/) on our website.**

### Testing

The tests for this library are written with Catch2, which is included as a subproject and does not need to be installed on your system. You can run the tests by issuing the following command:

```
make test
```

By default, test results are generated for use by the CI server and are formatted in JUnit XML. The test results XML files can be found in `buildresults/test/`. You can manually run the test programs if needed. 

For more information on testing, see [Unit Testing with Catch2](docs/UsingTheFramework/unit_testing_with_catch2.md).
