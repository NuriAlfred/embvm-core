# Principle: Defend the Decoupling Mechanisms

**Name:** Defend the Decoupling Mechanisms

Maintain the abstractions/layers. By preserving the separation of layers and using abstractions we maximize usability, portability, nad potential for reuse of our embedded software

Preserve the platform as the mediator between hardware and software
Tight coupling between HW/SW should be kept in the virtual platform abstraction
