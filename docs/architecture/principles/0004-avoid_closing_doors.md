# Principle: Avoid Closing Doors

**Name:** Avoid Closing Doors

Prefer decisions which do not reduce the possible actions that can be taken in the future. This is not always possible, but we want to deliberate if a choice cuts off future decisions.

We do not want to reduce the actions our client can take, or force them into a particular style. We want clients to be able to work in thier own style and as their system design dictacts.

Our architectural decisiosn should not hinder our clients.
