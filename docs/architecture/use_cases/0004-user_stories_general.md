## Story List

* As a user, I want to see a list of processors, drivers, and platforms that are supported by the framework so that I can:
	* evaluate the framework's suitability for my project
	* estimate how much time the framework saves me
	* determine what parts to use on my board, since I want to use the framework
* As a user, I want to understand what kinds of systems the framework can be applied to / is best used for so that I can evaluate the framework's suitability for my project
* As a user, I want to estimate bring-up schedules with and without the framework so that I can:
	* evaluate the framework's suitability for my project
	* estimate how much time the framework saves me
	* determine what parts to use on my board, since I want to use the framework
* As a user, I want to know what features are supported so that I can:
	* evaluate the framework's suitability for my project
	* estimate how much time the framework saves me
* As a user, I want to know what upgrades and roadmaps I can expect in the near future so that I can evaluate the framework's suitability to my purpose.
	* time period: 1 year roadmap? 6 mon?
	* What's the release schedule?

For this story:

> As a user, I want to estimate bring-up schedules with and without the framework

We can provide standard estimate ranges for internal development (driver takes us a week) and external development (if you do it, driver takes you 1.5-2 weeks)

Do we create a web-page or spreadsheet that we can use for estimations? Do we just provide reference calculations? Do we ship with a command line tool that does it?

* Number of drivers that are supported
* Number of drivers that are not yet supported
