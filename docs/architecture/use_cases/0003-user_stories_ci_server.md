## Story List

* As a build server, I want to compile software so I can ensure that there are no build problems.
* As a build server, I want to run tests and collect the test results so I can:
	* ensure there are no build problems
	* provide a report of test results to users
	* Report the proper failure mode
* As a build server, I want to control the output location of a build (i.e., out-of-source) so I can build multiple configurations while only checking out the repository once.

## Acceptance Criteria

TBD

## Associated Mechanisms

* Build system
* Unit test framework
* Static analysis framework
