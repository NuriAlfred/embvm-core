# Architecture Scratchpad

These are collected notes and musings that are related to the framework architecture but don't have a proper home (yet).

## To Process

* Most users aren't interested in customizing software they buy from a vendor.
* Extensibility won't make up for a weak product.
* You may think that you can design and implement a better component. That may be true, but unless your needs are extremely simple, your development cost will be much higher than the licensing cost.
* A third-party component will usually be better designed and have fewer bugs than the one you develop. The component vendor is usually a specialist who has a long head-start on you. Other organizations are likely using the components it's likely that many of the bugs have already been fixed. Also, the vendor, not you, is responsible for fixing any bugs, saving you even more time and effort
