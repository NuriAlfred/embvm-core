## Notes

Saket said this was something they skipped up front. When they finally implemented it, there was a significant time delay.

Logging from the beginning:

* log sensor / function calls
* Make available to external service somehow (API to get data)
* Would be nice if this was sync'd together with a data parsing service
* E.g. define events, add "update" points. The framework then handles counts & frequencies & averages.
