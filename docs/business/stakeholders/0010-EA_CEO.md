# Stakeholder Analysis

* **Name:** Phillip Johnston
* **Company:** Embedded Artistry
* **Role:** Principal Partner, Managing Member

Phillip runs Embedded Artistry, a consulting firm in San Francisco which supports new hardware startups with early-stage firmware and product development

## Background Notes

* Phillip runs EA and wants to sell the framework
* Phillip is focused on improving the quality of software deliveries and reducing the amount of code we write over-and-over again

## Related Documents

* Phillip is also EA's principle [developer](0009-EA_developer.md), which provides a different set of goals and needs
* Rozi is EA's [project manager](0011-EA_project_manager.md)

## Stakeholder Story

Phillip is repeatedly approached by inexperienced CEOs who make crazy short-term work requests, such as porting an entire firmware code base from one chip to another in a 30-day period to meet a manufacturing deadline. Phillip cannot take on these projects because he is not properly equipped to meet the deadlines. By having a framework which can be used as the basis for each project, he can accelerate the timelines needed to complete projects, re-use code for faster development cycles, and support an increasing number of projects.

## Empathy Map

### What are they seeing?

* Companies re-using the same processors and components
* Companies with crazy schedules
* Companies come back to us after a few months, and they made no progress
* Hardware companies failing left and right
* Companies hiring too many (junior) developers

### What are they hearing?

* Crazy requests with impossible schedules
* Difficulty in hiring firmware engineers
* About lack of architecture leading to engineering difficulties
* About lack of experienced firmware engineers who understand CS concepts & program design
* "Do you want a job?"

### What are they saying?

* "The project can't be done int hat amount of time"
* "Our schedules don't line up"
* "It's going to take you 3-4 months to hire a firmware engineer"
* "I can tackle that for you"
* "I've used that chip/part before"

### What are they thinking?

* These requests are crazy
* We are tired of doing the same projects and writing the same code over-and-over again from scratch
* I want to leverage my learnings for improved productivy and better designs

### What are they feeling?

* Unsure of how well the framework can be monetized
* Convinced that there is value in having a framework
* Ready to use the framework internally, even if it can't be easily licensed

### What are they doing?

* Taking time off of consulting to build the framework
* Researching competitors and alternative frameworks for inspiration and design reviews
* Taking software architecture classes
* Talking to potential leads about the framework being built
* Interviewing stakeholders to identify their needs for the framework
