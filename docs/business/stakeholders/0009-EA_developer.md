## Stakeholder Story

Phillip is a firmware developer. He is always being asked to meet crazy deadlines and to write software for the same selection of components. He's tired of doing the same basic work over-and-over again. If he had a re-usable design that could be applied to multiple projects, he would love to tackle more projects at a faster pace. He would also feel more satisfied because he would be able to leverage the previous software he's developed to increase his capabilities on future projects.
