# Stakeholder Analysis: CEO of Amina

* **Name:** James
* **Company:** Amina
* **Role:** CEO

James is the CEO of Amina, a company trying to deliver a device which can provide vitamin analysis in your home.

James is a chemist/materials scientist. Software is not his strong point.

Amina is a Bolt company

## Background Notes

James reached out to us to help re-implement his firmware. The initial implementation was done by a new college grad and was quite buggy and unreliable. He needed to start over.

Timeframes are tight - he wanted to quickly get this re-written and into the hands of 100+ users for testing. Willing to have some featuers cut to accomplish this.
