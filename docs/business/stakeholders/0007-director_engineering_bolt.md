# Stakeholder Analysis: Director of Engineering at Bolt

* **Name:** Tyler Mincey
* **Company:** Bolt (VC Firm)
* **Role:** Director of Engineering

Tyler is the Director of Engineering at Bolt. Bolt is an early-stage HW-focused venture capital firm in San Francisco. Bolt maintains an internal engineering team, covering ME, EE, ID, and some firmware. Bolt assists portfolio companies with their engineering expertise and some small-scale design work.

## Background Notes

Bolt is planning to invest in 25 companies with their third fund. They are scaling up and will be hard-pressed to support the engineering efforts of all 25 companies.

Bolt does not typically support their clients with full-scale firmware efforts. Their EEs do write firmware from time-to-time, but usually with bare minimum bring-up.

Bolt companies have contacted Embedded Artistry multiple times for short-term development and porting efforts.
